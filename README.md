# Arrow predictor

This is a simple C program that predicts what arrow key you'll press next using a probabilistic model. It's similar to
the core of the TokiLM-p language model.

## Compiling
Simple:
```sh
cc arrowpredictor.c -o arrowpredictor
```

## Usage
Run the program without any arguments. It'll throw away any arguments you give to it, anyways. You'll be presented a
TUI explaining how to use this program and what it does.
